## Phase 1 Summary
Created shared infrastructure for Agent Teams integration. Added `scripts/check-agent-teams.ts` which validates the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` feature flag and parses team templates from `.devorch/team-templates.md`. Returns JSON with enabled status and team configs (with sensible defaults when file missing). Added `.devorch/team-templates.md` with default templates for all 5 command types: debug (4 investigators), review (4 reviewers), explore-deep (3 explorers + synthesizer), make-plan-team (2 analysts), check-team (3 adversarial reviewers).

## Phase 2 Summary
Created three new Agent Teams command files: `commands/debug.md` (hypothesis-testing investigation with 4 parallel investigators), `commands/review.md` (adversarial multi-perspective code review with security/quality/performance/tests roles), and `commands/explore-deep.md` (architectural exploration with independent explorers and synthesizer). All three gate behind CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS via check-agent-teams.ts, read team templates from .devorch/team-templates.md with fallback defaults, use TeammateTool spawnTeam for team creation, and auto-commit reports to .devorch/.

## Phase 3 Summary
Added optional Agent Teams modes to two existing commands. `commands/make-plan.md` gained step 3 "Agent Teams exploration (conditional)" — auto-escalates to a 2-analyst team (scope-explorer + risk-assessor) when complexity=complex or --team flag is present, errors with setup instructions when --team used without feature flag, skips entirely otherwise. `commands/check-implementation.md` gained step 4 "Adversarial review (conditional)" — spawns a 3-reviewer team (security + quality + performance) when --team flag is present, adds Adversarial Review section to report template. Both commands preserve all existing workflow steps and are fully backward-compatible without the --team flag.
