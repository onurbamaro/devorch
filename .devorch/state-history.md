## Phase 1 Summary
Created shared infrastructure for Agent Teams integration. Added `scripts/check-agent-teams.ts` which validates the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` feature flag and parses team templates from `.devorch/team-templates.md`. Returns JSON with enabled status and team configs (with sensible defaults when file missing). Added `.devorch/team-templates.md` with default templates for all 5 command types: debug (4 investigators), review (4 reviewers), explore-deep (3 explorers + synthesizer), make-plan-team (2 analysts), check-team (3 adversarial reviewers).

## Phase 2 Summary
Created three new Agent Teams command files: `commands/debug.md` (hypothesis-testing investigation with 4 parallel investigators), `commands/review.md` (adversarial multi-perspective code review with security/quality/performance/tests roles), and `commands/explore-deep.md` (architectural exploration with independent explorers and synthesizer). All three gate behind CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS via check-agent-teams.ts, read team templates from .devorch/team-templates.md with fallback defaults, use TeammateTool spawnTeam for team creation, and auto-commit reports to .devorch/.
