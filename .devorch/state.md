# devorch State
- Plan: Devorch Unification — Single Command + Waste Elimination
- Last completed phase: 4
- Status: plan complete

## Phase 4 Summary
Unified /devorch command created with 3-path routing (conversation, quick, plan). Old commands/make-plan.md and commands/quick.md deleted. Quick path preserves exact 5-item binary checklist. Plan path auto-builds simple/medium (--review to pause), pauses complex (--auto to skip). Conversation path uses Agent Teams when available, Explore agents as fallback. All cross-references updated in commands, CONVENTIONS.md, and README.md. Zero references to old commands in active .md files. CONVENTIONS.md updated: no state-history.md mention, shared lib note added. README.md rewritten with /devorch as sole entry point.
