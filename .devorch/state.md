- Plan: Attractive README and MIT License
- Last completed phase: 1
- Status: complete

## Phase 1 Summary
Created MIT LICENSE file (year 2026, author Bruno Amaro) and added license field to package.json. Rewrote README.md with marketing-friendly tone: hero section with value proposition, benefits section (zero context switching, parallel execution, automatic validation, state-aware resumption), quick start guide, workflow examples, full commands reference, Agent Teams section, and a structured LLM-friendly metadata block at the bottom. All validation criteria passed.
